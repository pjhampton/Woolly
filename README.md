> ### Woolly ~ The Text Mining Elixir.
> Woolly is a Text Mining & Natural Language Processing API for the Elixir programming language. 

- Disclaimer: This is very early work and while some features work, others don't. Get involved!

## Getting started

Woolly is [available in Hex](https://hex.pm/), install it by adding it to your project `mix.exs` file as so:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:woolly, "~> 0.1.0"}]
end
```

If you're not using [Hex](http://hex.pm/), you can add it via this github repository:

```elixir
def deps do
  [{:woolly, github: "pjhampton/Woolly"}]
end
```
...and don't forget to run `mix deps.get` from the terminal to fetch and compile your workspace dependencies.
